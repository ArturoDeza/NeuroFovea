# "Towards Metamerism via Foveated Style Transfer" 
Code to reproduce the Metamers used in the paper (Deza, Jonnalagadda, Eckstein. ICLR 2019). Link to the paper and discussion in openreview: https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJzbG20cFQ

Code has been tested successfully on Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, and 18.04 with CUDA version 8.0 (Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04) and 10.0 (Ubuntu 18.04)

The backbone of this code is mainly driven:
* Adaptive Instance Normalization code
* a mixture of localized foveated templates stored in the main folder for the different rate of growth of the receptive fields specified by the scaling factor which should match the human psychophysical testing procedure as specified in the paper.
